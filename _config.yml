  Hello! In 2021 I'm making the jump from 20 years in trades to an online skillset and a healthier lifestyle. I'm incredibly fond of working with people from around the world, from all walks of life. I thrive on discovering the goals of others and finding ways to get them there. It's a lot like building sailboats - pulling lines out of thin air and making them real with any tool available, many of them improvised or built specifically for the task.

  I bring wisdom and experience from multiple fields including; 
  * Sailboat building and repair
  * Tiny-home construction
  * Semi-professional musician
  * Kitchen work 
  * Managing several meditation centers 
  * Permaculture farming
  * Teaching ESL abroad

    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      I spend my downtime surfing, hunting mushrooms, playing chess, and walking the beautiful forests and trails of the Kootenays with my dog. I'm passionate about learning, healthy living, the environment, and social issues. I believe a better world is possible and I'm extremely happy to be here to see it unfold. I have a certificate in **Mental Health First-Aid**, I've hitchiked most of North-America, I've done stand-up comedy, and I love writing elevator pitches with a fourth-wall break at the end.
