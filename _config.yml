about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs

  I'm making the jump from 20 years in trades to an online skillset and a healthier lifestyle. I'm incredibly fond of static site generators and I'm having a blast learning frontend web design. It's a lot like building sailboats - pulling lines out of thin air and making them real with any tool available, many of them improvised or built specifically for the task.

  I bring wisdom and experience from multiple fields including; 
  * tiny-home construction
  * semi-professional musician
  * kitchen work 
  * boat building
  * managing several meditation centers 
  * permaculture farming
  * teaching ESL abroad

      I spend my downtime surfing, playing chess, and walking the beautiful forests and trails of Vancouver Island. I'm passionate about learning, healthy living, the environment, and social issues. I believe a better world is possible and I'm extremely happy to be here to see it unfold.
